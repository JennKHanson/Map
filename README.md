* A huge thank you goes to my fellow Udacity scholars for helping me throughout the course. A special thanks goes to Jason Michael White, Doug Brown, Sachin Sharmam, and Brenda for helping me complete Project 7. Also, I wouldn't have finished without the incredible Indiana cohort of Daphne, Sarah, Therese, Fate, Crystal, Jamila, and Aly!
